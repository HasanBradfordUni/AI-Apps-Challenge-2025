# AI Assistant Demo Project

This project serves as a simple demonstration script, primarily intended to illustrate the functionality of an AI Programming Assistant in generating documentation. The code defines a few basic functions that perform a simple calculation and print the result to the console.

## 1. Project Description

The program consists of three main functions:
- `codingFunction()`: Performs a hardcoded arithmetic operation (`2 + 2`) and prints a status message.
- `outputNumber()`: Takes a number as input and prints it to the console.
- `main()`: The main entry point of the script that orchestrates the calls to the other two functions.

The script is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, making it an ideal candidate for automated documentation generation.

## 2. Installation

This project uses only the standard Python library, so no external packages are required.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.6 or newer

**Steps:**
1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-demo-project.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ai-demo-project
    ```
That's it! No `pip install` or virtual environment setup is necessary.

## 3. Usage

To run the program, execute the Python script from your terminal.

```sh
python your_script_name.py
```
*(Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of the file.)*

**Expected Output:**

The script will first print a message from `codingFunction` and then the result of the calculation.

```
This is a coding function
4
```

## 4. API Documentation

This section details the functions available in the script.

---

### `codingFunction()`

Prints a message and performs a simple addition.

- **Description:** This function prints the string "This is a coding function" to the standard output. It then calculates the sum of 2 and 2.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Returns:**
  - `int`: The result of the `2 + 2` operation, which is always `4`.
- **Side Effects:** Prints a line to the console.

---

### `outputNumber(num)`

Prints a given number to the console.

- **Description:** This function takes a single numerical argument and prints its value to the standard output.
- **Arguments:**
  - `num` (int | float): The number to be printed.
- **Returns:** None.
- **Side Effects:** Prints the value of `num` to the console.

---

### `main()`

The main entry point for the script.

- **Description:** This function orchestrates the script's execution. It calls `codingFunction()` to get a number and then passes that number to `outputNumber()` to be displayed.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Returns:** None.
