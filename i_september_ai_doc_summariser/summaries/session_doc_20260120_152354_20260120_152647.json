For further information about study abroad opportunities please refer to https://www.bradford.ac.uk/study/abroad/ . © UNIVERSITY OF BRADFORD PAGE 7 Learning and Teaching S trategy Our Learning and Teaching Strategy is to provide a nurturing and supportive environment that en ables students to become an independent learners and problem solvers. Students will be supported via various approaches including e.g. learning in small groups and in practical laboratory sessions where discussions and formative feedbacks are embedded, having the support of lecturers , demonstrators and project supervisor, who all provide academic support and guidance. Stude nts will al so have their own personal academic tutor who provide academic and pastoral care throughout the programme of study. Students will also have the opportunity to be part of the University of Bradford Computing Society for students, PiSoc , as well a s the Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) scheme, where students are able to meet with other fellow Computer Science students at different stages of their study. The programme is designed to develop your knowledge and skills in ways to allow gradual trans ition fr om one stage to the next. From Stage 1 onwards, students will experience a wide range of teaching and learning environments and a consistent balance between direct academic delivery, and individual and group study . Concepts, principles and theories are exp lored in formal lectures, practiced in associated tutorials and seminars, and demonstrated and experimented in laboratory classes. Practical skills are developed in laboratory sessions. Professional and personal skills are developed through the Technical a nd Professional Skills module which involves communications skills, library skills, group work and presentations. The Enterprise -Pro module develops an appreciation of how to manage group dynamics whilst working on a substantial computing and software engineering exercise. Honours students undertake a major individual project in their final year, drawing together the knowledge and experience g ained throughout the programme. The project provides the opportunity for students to demonstrate the ability to solve problems using current ideas and current, innovative techniques that are at the forefront of computing and applied multidisciplinary disciplines. Each 20 -credit modu le on the programme requires students to commit 200 hours of study. Many of these hours will be formally timetabled - lectures, laboratories, seminars and tutoria ls – and others will involve students carrying out private study or group work . The balance between these forms of study changes as students pass through the three years of the programme. There are many contact hours (time spent with academic tutors) in all stages of the programme; in the final year students will also be expected to manage thei r plan for the individual project , under the general guidance of thei r academic tutors. In addition, t he learning and teaching on the programme are informed by industry and by staff undertaking KTP projects, national and EU funded r esearch projects and consultancy work that embed new knowledge and concepts into our teaching materials and curriculum planning; and inviting industrial speakers. Throughout the academic year industr y speakers and researchers are also invited to give talks and lectures that inform and inspire our students about current and future developments within their disciplines. For further information on industry talks and research seminars please refer to https://www.bradford.ac.uk/ei/computer -science/research/ . Innovative projects initiated by industry are also embedded within a number of the modules , such as Technical and Professional Ski lls (level 4), Enterprise -Pro (level 5) and © UNIVERSITY OF BRADFORD PAGE 8 Final Year Project (level 6) , through our Computing Enterprise Centre , allowing students to work on topics that are highly r elevant to thei r future c areers throughout the course. Students will also have the oppo rtunity to interact with our I ndependent Computing Industry Advisory Board members and a wider audience of industry contacts during the Final Year P roject Showcase, which allows them to demonstrate thei r work and to receive feedback and ideas from professionals within the discipline. Further, the programme employs several advanced active learning methods. For example, Team Based Learning (TBL) strategies are integrated within several modules. W e also endeavour to use team teaching methods where lect uring staff can contribute their specialised research and knowledge into the curriculum. Throughout the programme, we make use of case studies so that students can apply thei r theoretical understanding to real- world issues. In this way, abstract concepts are brought to life through practical activities. We use CANVAS to share course materials and reading lists, communicate with students, track student participation, facilitate discussions, support formative and summative assessments and provide feedback. Students can use Canvas independently to revise materials, ask questions and interact with lecturers and other students using discussions, practise and assess their understanding using quizzes, or for finding resources for further reading. In addition to the standard technology enhanced learning approaches, we embed technologies to deliver key concepts in an interactive environment that strongly links theory with practical skills. For example: in programming lectures, a remote desktop application allows le cturers to demonstrate coding in an environment identical to that in our cutting -edge labs; our Enterprise -Pro module (level 5) requires and supports students to develop thei r projects using an industry standard tool for collaborative team -based software development. This allows students to develop industry standard skills based on real working practice. Our curriculum development is informed by the research conducted by academic members of staff within the School , exposing students to current developments within the related fields of expertise. K nowledge and experience from Industrial partners are also integrated within the programme through both our Industry Advisory Board and research projects through case studies, lab -based activities and inv ited talks, ensuring that research findings are at the heart of our curriculum. Equality, diversity and inclusion are embedded in our programme ’s learning and teaching activities. We celebrate differences and ensure that everyone has equal opportunities to achieve their desired outcomes. Students are also instilled with the understanding of ethical and professional issues within the co ntext of computer science and IT and the responsibilities around these issues. Students will be encouraged to explore a dive rse range of digital technologies and theories and engage constructively with businesses and communities to enrich their understanding of the impact of Computer Science on everyone's everyday lives and embrace the values of equality, diversity and inclusio n in their development of Computer Science solutions. This approach will equip students with © UNIVERSITY OF BRADFORD PAGE 9 the wider perspective of the relevance of Computer Science for the betterment of businesses and society. Assessment Strategy Methods of assessme nt are varied , and progress will be assessed using a mix of formal examinations, presentations and seminar papers, reports, laboratory tests, essays, coursework assignments, and projects. Formative assessments are also used to allow feedback to be provided, strengths an d areas of improvement to be identified. The appropri ate method is chosen so that students may demonstrate the learning outcomes of each module. All our staff have achieved, or are working towards, Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). As part of our commitment to Excellence in Learning and Teaching, we conduct research into innovative and effective teaching and assessment methods. For example, assessment for our Final Year Project module was enhanced by incorporating regular formative and summ ative feedback opportunities to enhance the final outcomes, based on a research project conducted by staff within the School that culminated in a journal publication.
